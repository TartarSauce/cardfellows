# Final group project for Codefellows 201 class

**Project Description:**

**cardfellows** is a game designed and implemented by a CodeFellows team from
the 201 class (May 9 2016 - June 3 2016).

The game is a memory game. The game is a grid of 18 cards, laid out in 3 rows of
6 each. The game starts with all the cards shown face up. The player has 5 seconds to memorize locations of the cards with faces of instructor and TAs. The timer starts
when the cards go face down. The player must recall the locations of the staff and
click on them. If the player successfully clicks all cards for staff, its a
successful game and scores are logged. One wrong click and the game ends.

Score is the amount of time in seconds taken to complete a game successfully. For a returning user, the highest score is used in the ranking table.

The game times out and all positions are reset if the moves are not completed in
3 minutes.
